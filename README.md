# Fullstack project Netflix data set and REST API
This project was made as part of the Technigo bootcamp.

The goal of this project was to practice creating APIs using Express. The task was to creat APIs with different RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

As a frontend I chose to build a multipage Progressive Web Application using React Router
